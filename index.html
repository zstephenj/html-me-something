    <h1>Where I Began</h1>
    <p>
            I started the year 2018 with just about zero prior experience in coding. Having always been quite tech-savvy, I always 
        held coding in the back of my mind as something I wanted to learn. However, not knowing where to start and not having 
        any individualized support was enough to intimidate me from taking any first steps.

    <h2>First Contact</h2> 
    <p>
            While attending the University of Missouri - Kansas City (UMKC), I obtained a ticket from the school to attend TechWeek,
        a technology and entrepreneurship conference. By chance, I stopped by the LaunchCode booth to see what it was about, and
        the fact that it was founded in my hometown of Saint Louis caught my attention and stuck LaunchCode firmly in the back of
        my mind.

    <h2>Pulling the Trigger</h2> 
    <p>
        When I returned to Saint Louis, I missed the deadline to apply for LaunchCode. I still did some basic research into coding
        and the job prospects of the industry. When the applications opened for the next cohort of LaunchCode, I
        immediately applied and was finally accepted and jumpstarted my coding experience. The pre-work for the course was my first
        taste of not just real coding, but applying it to real problems. I knew it could make or break my motivation, and it really
        grew my confidence and got me excited to code.

    <h1>Where I Stand Today</h1>
    <p>
        Today, in September of 2018, I am nearing the halfway point through the LaunchCode LC101 course, but assuredly not the
        halfway point of my coding journey. I am confident in my ability to understand what is going on in the background of coding
        and my apprehension is gone.

    <h2>Skills I Have Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Through LaunchCode, I took a deepdive into what coding processes are doing in the background of the everyday applications 
        we use on our computers and phones. I can now use the Python language to make my own programs that organize and manipulate
         data. I have a basic ability to build webpages using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and to organize the text using Cascading
         Style Sheets (CSS).

     <h1>Where I Hope to Go</h1>
     <p>
     The future of my journey is what excites me most. LaunchCode has helped me build a foundation upon which my coding skills can
     grow and improve for years to come. My main goal right now is not to get anywhere specifically, but to become well-rounded
      enough to be able to go anywhere in my journey.

    <h2>Languages to Learn</h2>
    <p>
        The syntax of Python has given me a solid understanding of how to "speak" to my computer through code. I hope that it will
        make learning new languages much easier. I hope to pursue Java through my LaunchCode course, but also to work on C#
        concurrently if the workload allows.

     <h2>Free Resources to Learn Coding</h2>
     <p>
        My whole journey thus far has been achieved without spending 1&cent;. I hope to continue building my coding skills using
        the plethora of resources that have become available to everyone online for free. I encourage you to check some of these out,
        as they are a great way to expose yourself to coding basics at no risk or cost to yourself other than some time.
